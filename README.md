# exploratory projects

This is a permanent/ongoing project. What youâ€™ll do is, for each project on the list below, add a folder to this repository. Make meaningful commits as you work on the projects and push them to your GitHub repo, so that Courtland can look at them and so that your work is saved somewhere permanent.
